#Introduction

This is a simple demonstration of how to use Tika to extract text
and metadata from binary files using Pig. This is done via a UDF. 

Also, in order to read files
from HDFS, a WholeFileLoader is created, which takes a directory and
loads generates tuples containing the location and the binary content.
This is obviously just for demonstration purposes to read files in; 
generally you would want to load many files into an aggregate file
format (i.e. sequence file via Sqoop or Mahout).

A demonstration pig script is provided to illustrate dumping a
directory's file contents along with metadata.

#Building

Building requires maven, but is self contained.  Requires only:
     mvn clean package

This will create a tarball in the target directory called textProcessing-1.0-SNAPSHOT-archive.tar.gz


#Usage

Usage is as follows, where the assumptions are that you are on a unix
machine and you have a directory in HDFS called input_dir with files in
it and wish to extract those files into output_dir, a directory on HDFS:
     tar xzvf textProcessing-1.0-SNAPSHOT-archive.tar.gz
     pig -param input=input_dir -param output=output_dir pig/dump.pig
